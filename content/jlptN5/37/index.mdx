## Things like ~ and ~ たり～たりする

> Grammar:Conjunctive form + たり～たりする
> This structure is used to list actions, implying that there are other actions besides those mentioned. "たり" indicates that the actions listed are just examples.

**私は昨日、映画を見たり、友達と会ったりしました。**  
I watched a movie and met with friends yesterday.

In this sentence, the speaker is listing two actions they did yesterday: watching a movie and meeting with friends. The use of "たり～たりする" indicates that these actions are part of a series of events that happened in the past.

**休みの日は水曜日だったり、日曜日だったりです。**  
On weekends, we are closed on Wednesdays and Sundays.

**私は休みの日に本を読んだり、音楽を聞いたりします。**  
I sometimes read books and sometimes listen to music on my days off.

Previously, we learned that "Nouns や Nouns など" is used to list part of items, while "～たり～たりする" is used when listing actions. For example, if during vacation, one might read books or listen to music, these are just some of the actions listed, not limited to just reading or listening to music, it could also include watching TV, playing games, and other actions. If you want to list all actions, you don't need "たり", you can just write the original sentence, like "私は休みの日に本を読みました" (I read a book on my day off)".
