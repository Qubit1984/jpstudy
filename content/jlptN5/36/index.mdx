## だけ (Only)

> Grammar: Grammar: Noun + だけ / Verb (Attributive Form) + だけ / Adjective (い) + だけ / Adjectival noun (な) + だけ / Adverb + だけ

The particle 「だけ」 is used to indicate "only" or "just" in Japanese. It can be used to express that something is limited to a certain amount, degree, or extent. It can be used with both nouns and verbs.

**1. これだけ買いました。**  
Only bought this one.

**2. 私は水だけを飲みます。**  
I only drink water.

**3. この本は白黒だけです。**  
This book is only black and white.

**4. 私は昨日、テレビを見るだけで、本を読まなかった。**  
I only watched TV yesterday and didn't read any books."

**5.あの映画は面白いだけでなく、感動的です。**  
That movie is not only interesting but also moving.

**6.その町は静かなだけでなく、美しい景色もあります。**  
That town is not only quiet but also has beautiful scenery.

When "だけ" is followed by "が" or "を", as in example 2, it can also be omitted, as in example 1 (これだけを買いました → これだけ買いました). When followed by "が" or "を", there is an emphasis on "だけ". "ちょっとだけ" means "just a little bit" or "just a little," and adjectival nouns need to add "な", as in example 5, while adjectives can directly connect with だけ, as in example 6.

When making a negative assertion, "だけ" becomes "だけではない (だけじゃない) / だけではありません (だけじゃありません)" etc.

## しか…ない（Only ）

> Grammar: Noun + しか...ない / Verb (Terminal Form) + しか...ない

しか～ない" is used similarly to "だけ" to express exclusivity or limitation, but it implies a negative connotation, suggesting there is nothing else but what is mentioned.

**彼は日本語しか話せません。**  
He can only speak Japanese.

**私は今日時間がないので、勉強しかできません。**  
I don't have time today, so I can only study.

**行くしかありません。**  
There is no choice but to go.

## Difference between "だけ" and "しか...ない":

だけ: Simple description.
しか...ない: Emphasizes insufficiency.

"だけ" emphasizes a limitation or restriction, indicating that something applies solely to a particular thing or situation. It doesn't necessarily imply a sense of inadequacy or constraint and can be used in positive, neutral, or negative contexts.
"しか...ない" expresses a stronger sense of exclusivity and limitation compared to "だけ." It conveys the idea that there is nothing else besides what is mentioned, often implying a sense of insufficiency or restriction. This structure is always followed by a negative verb form "ない" to emphasize the absence of alternatives.

**"彼は家でだけ勉強します。"**  
He only studies at home.

**"彼は家でしか勉強できない。"**  
He can only study at home.

In summary, while both "だけ" and "しか...ない" convey the idea of exclusivity or limitation, "しか...ない" emphasizes the absence of alternatives more strongly and often implies a sense of inadequacy or constraint. "だけ," on the other hand, is more neutral and can be used in a wider range of contexts without necessarily carrying a negative connotation.
