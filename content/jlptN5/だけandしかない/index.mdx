## だけ (Only)

> Grammar: Grammar: Noun + だけ / Verb (Attributive Form) + だけ / Adjective (い) + だけ / Adjectival noun (な) + だけ / Adverb + だけ

The particle 「だけ」 is used to indicate "only" or "just" in Japanese. It can be used to express that something is limited to a certain amount, degree, or extent. It can be used with both nouns and verbs.

<Example
  ja="これだけ買いました。"
  en="Only bought this one."
  src="/jlptN5/36-1.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="私は水だけを飲みます。"
  en="I only drink water."
  src="/jlptN5/36-2.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="私は昨日、テレビを見るだけで、本を読まなかった。"
  en="I only watched TV yesterday and didn't read any books."
  src="/jlptN5/36-3.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="あの映画は面白いだけでなく、感動的です。"
  en="That movie is not only interesting but also moving."
  src="/jlptN5/36-4.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="その町は静かなだけでなく、美しい景色もあります。"
  en="That town is not only quiet but also has beautiful scenery."
  src="/jlptN5/36-5.mp3"
/>
When "だけ" is followed by "が" or "を", as in example 2, it can also be omitted,
as in example 1 (これだけを買いました → これだけ買いました). When followed by "が"
or "を", there is an emphasis on "だけ". "ちょっとだけ" means "just a little bit"
or "just a little," and adjectival nouns need to add "な", as in example 5, while
adjectives can directly connect with だけ, as in example 4.

When making a negative assertion, "だけ" becomes "だけではない (だけじゃない) / だけではありません (だけじゃありません)" etc.

## しか…ない（Only ）

> Grammar: Noun + しか...ない / Verb (Terminal Form) + しか...ない

しか～ない" is used similarly to "だけ" to express exclusivity or limitation, but it implies a negative connotation, suggesting there is nothing else but what is mentioned.

<Example
  ja="彼は日本語しか話せません。"
  en="He can only speak Japanese."
  src="/jlptN5/36-6.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="私は今日時間がないので、勉強しかできません。"
  en="I don't have time today, so I can only study."
  src="/jlptN5/36-7.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="行くしかありません。"
  en="There is no choice but to go."
  src="/jlptN5/36-8.mp3"
/>

## Difference between "だけ" and "しか...ない":

だけ: Simple description.
しか...ない: Emphasizes insufficiency.

"だけ" emphasizes a limitation or restriction, indicating that something applies solely to a particular thing or situation. It doesn't necessarily imply a sense of inadequacy or constraint and can be used in positive, neutral, or negative contexts.
"しか...ない" expresses a stronger sense of exclusivity and limitation compared to "だけ." It conveys the idea that there is nothing else besides what is mentioned, often implying a sense of insufficiency or restriction. This structure is always followed by a negative verb form "ない" to emphasize the absence of alternatives.

**"彼は家でだけ勉強します。"**  
He only studies at home.

**"彼は家でしか勉強できない。"**  
He can only study at home.

In summary, while both "だけ" and "しか...ない" convey the idea of exclusivity or limitation, "しか...ない" emphasizes the absence of alternatives more strongly and often implies a sense of inadequacy or constraint. "だけ," on the other hand, is more neutral and can be used in a wider range of contexts without necessarily carrying a negative connotation.
