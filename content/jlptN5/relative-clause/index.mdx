## What is an attributive modifier?

An attributive modifier refers to an attributive phrase or attributive form
e.g. <Spanred>あの</Spanred>​ 店、<Spanred>厚い ​</Spanred>辞書、<Spanred>綺麗な ​</Spanred>人、<Spanred>咲く ​</Spanred>花
The words in red are attributive modifiers.

## What are attributive phrases and attributive forms?

Simply put, there are two types of attributive modifiers: attributive words and attributive forms. Attributive words include "この" (this), "その" (that), "あの" (that), and so on. Attributive forms refer to the conjugated forms of verbs, adjectives, and adjectival verbs used to modify nouns. These are the inflected forms used when connecting verbs, adjectives, or adjectival verbs to nouns (inflection refers to changes in word endings), such as the "きれいな" in "きれいな人" (beautiful person). The "体" (form) in attributive words and attributive forms refers to the "form" of nouns. Therefore, "連体" (attributive) means connecting to nouns, or modifying nouns. Since we haven't learned about adjectives, adjectival verbs, and verbs in this lesson yet, let's just have a basic understanding for now.
