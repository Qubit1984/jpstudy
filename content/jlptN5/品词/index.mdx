## What is parts of speech in Japanese ?

Before delving into grammar, let's first get acquainted with the parts of speech in Japanese. This can help accurately understand the meanings of these specialized terms in subsequent studies. Although learning these specialized terms may seem a bit complex or challenging at the beginning, mastering them is crucial for laying a solid language foundation. Moreover, as we delve deeper into advanced studies in the future, this foundational knowledge will prove immensely helpful.

The classification of words in Japanese is called "Parts of Speech" (品詞). Parts of Speech are mainly divided into ten types, hence also known as the "Ten Major Parts of Speech". The ten major parts of speech are "verb, adjective, adjectival noun, noun, adverb, adnominal, conjunction, interjection, auxiliary verb, and particle." These parts of speech have differences such as independent words, dependent words, inflectional, and non-inflectional, and the following will provide a more detailed explanation of their classification.

      <td>
        Words that can function as an adjective by taking the particle 〜な -na.
        (In comparison, regular nouns can function adjectivally by taking the
        particle 〜の -no, which is analyzed as the genitive case.)

      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Particles(助詞)</td>
      <td>
        Words that connect two different words or sentences and establish a
        relationship or add meaning.

## What are 体言(たいげん)and 用言(ようげん)?

用言(ようげん) refers to words with inflection, meaning they undergo changes in grammar, similar to how English has changes like "have → having." In Japanese, vocabulary changes include seven types of verb changes (Note 1), and five types of adjective changes, etc. These changes are marked as "V1, V2, V3…," or "A1, A2, A3…," indicating the order of verb or adjective changes. For example, "V5" represents the hypothetical form of the fifth verb change, and "Na3" represents the terminal form of the third adjectival verb change. These "inflectional forms" will be explained one by one in subsequent lessons. On the other hand, 体言(たいげん) refers to words without inflection, meaning they don't undergo changes, typically referring to nouns.

Note 1: According to Japanese national grammar, verbs are classified into six types, but there are actually seven types of inflectional changes. To facilitate beginners' understanding and mastery, Japanese verbs will be subdivided into seven basic changes on this platform, and it will be explained in subsequent lessons how the six changes are combined and classified.
