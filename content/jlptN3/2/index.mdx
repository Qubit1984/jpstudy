## かもしれない

> Pattern: (V/A/N/Na) + かもしれない

This pattern indicates speculation about something with a relatively low possibility, and the speaker often doesn't have much confidence. This usage is also often used to express one's opinion in a tactful manner, avoiding being too assertive, regardless of the size of the possibility. It can be translated as "maybe" or "possibly" in English, and in spoken language, it can be shortened to "かも" (kamo).

**明日は雨が降るかもしれない。**  
It might rain tomorrow.

**このレストランは美味しいかもしれない。**  
This restaurant might be delicious.

**映画は面白いかもしれませんが、時間がないので行けません。**  
The movie might be interesting, but I can't go because I don't have time.

In Japanese grammar, when using the more colloquial form "かも" (kamo), it is typically placed at the end of the sentence. This structure is often used in informal or spoken language to express uncertainty or possibility. Here's an explanation along with example sentences:

**彼は鍵を取ったのは彼かも。**  
He might be the one who took the keys.

**会議は延期されるかも。**  
The meeting might be postponed.

**コンサートは中止になるかも。**  
The concert might be canceled.

**彼女は携帯電話を忘れたかも。**  
She might have forgotten her phone.

"かも" is a more colloquial expression, used in conversations with friends or juniors. The polite form is "かもしれません" (kamoshiremasen).

**彼女は遅れてくるかもしれません。**
