## かもしれない

> Pattern: (V/A/N/Na) + かもしれない

This pattern indicates speculation about something with a relatively low possibility, and the speaker often doesn't have much confidence. This usage is also often used to express one's opinion in a tactful manner, avoiding being too assertive, regardless of the size of the possibility. It can be translated as "maybe" or "possibly" in English, and in spoken language, it can be shortened to "かも" (kamo).

<Example
  ja="明日は雨が降るかもしれない。"
  en="It might rain tomorrow."

<br />
<Example
  ja="このレストランは美味しいかもしれない。"
  en="This restaurant might be delicious."

<br />
<Example
  ja="映画は面白いかもしれませんが、時間がないので行けません。"
  en="The movie might be interesting, but I can't go because I don't have time."

In Japanese grammar, when using the more colloquial form "かも" (kamo), it is typically
placed at the end of the sentence. This structure is often used in informal or spoken
language to express uncertainty or possibility. Here's an explanation along with
example sentences2

<Example
  ja="ひょっとしたら、あの二人は待ち合わせてるかも"
  en="It's possible that those two have made plans to meet."

<br />
<Example
  ja="会議は延期されるかも。"
  en="The meeting might be postponed."
  src="/jlptN3/2-5.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="コンサートは中止になるかも。"
  en="The concert might be canceled."
  src="/jlptN3/2-6.mp3"
/>
<br />
<Example
  ja="彼女は携帯電話を忘れたかも。"
  en="She might have forgotten her phone."

/>

"かも" is a more colloquial expression, used in conversations with friends or juniors. The polite form is "かもしれません" (kamoshiremasen).

**彼女は遅れてくるかもしれません。**
