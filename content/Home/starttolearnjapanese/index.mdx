## Japanese Proficiency Levels

The JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) is divided into five levels, with N5 being the most basic and N1 being the highest. You can freely choose which level to take. Generally, fewer people take the N5 exam, and even for basic proficiency, N3 is usually required (for professional fields, N1 may be necessary, and at least N2 for most cases). Essentially, N5 and N4 don't have much practical functionality. Therefore, even beginners often choose to take the N4 exam directly as proof of their basic proficiency. However, if it's just for self-assessment, you can still take the N5 test, although it might be a bit costly.

The JLPT can be taken out of order. The most common progression for taking the JLPT is "N4 â†’ N2 â†’ N1" or "N4 â†’ N3 â†’ N2 â†’ N1". Ultimately, the level you aim for depends on your needs. If it's just for interest, you can choose any level you like. For travel or daily conversation, N3 is usually sufficient, while for employment or further education, it's better to aim for N1.

## Learning Direction

For beginners, start with the basic (N5) level. Each stage has specific skills to be mastered, including grammar, vocabulary, reading, listening, speaking, and writing. Among these, grammar and vocabulary are the most fundamental. Regardless of whether you're reading or writing, you'll need a combination of vocabulary and grammar.

Therefore, the learning direction is as follows:

Learn the Hiragana and Katakana scripts, including voiced, semi-voiced, contracted, long, and small characters.
Understand Japanese pronunciation and recognize vowel devoicing.
Download the Hiragana and Katakana charts.
Begin with N5 grammar (and then progress to N4~N1).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to memorize all the Hiragana before moving on to the next step?

You don't need to memorize them all at once. Just having an understanding after going through the lessons is enough (at least get acquainted with the environment). Then you can download the Hiragana and Katakana charts and proceed directly to learning N5 grammar. During the learning process, whenever you encounter an unfamiliar word, you can refer to the charts. This way, you'll remember each character in no time. Alternatively, learning through song lyrics is also effective and less boring. Of course, everyone has their own preferred method, so if you want to memorize all the characters quickly, go ahead and memorize them.

### What's the order of learning Japanese?

There's no fixed order. Some people learn a lot of Japanese just from watching anime, so there's no absolute learning method. However, here's a suggestion: while studying N5 grammar, also focus on learning vocabulary (N5 word list). If possible, read some simple articles or fairy tales (like Momotaro). While studying grammar, you can expose yourself to more Japanese. Don't wait until you've finished learning grammar to start reading. Whenever you have the chance, read and immerse yourself in Japanese. This will help you get used to the way Japanese is expressed and will be beneficial for your learning. After completing each stage, consider taking the JLPT to set goals and assess your progress.

### What if I don't understand something?

In the early stages of learning, you'll encounter many things you don't understand. Don't worry, just keep learning, and you'll find the answers eventually. Many beginners often ask questions about things that will be covered in later lessons. These questions may be premature, similar to asking about square roots when you've just learned addition and subtraction. Japanese grammar is somewhat similar in that regard. You need some basic knowledge to understand these questions. Also, many questions may remain difficult to understand even after they've been explained. In such cases, it often requires gradually gaining reading experience in Japanese. Therefore, if you have questions in the early stages, it's best to save them, try to find the answers yourself, or accumulate some experience in Japanese first. If you still can't find the answers after studying for a while, then it's better to ask questions. This way, it will be easier for others to answer because you already have some foundation.

These are just some directional suggestions. Learning varies from person to person, and some people learn through immersion. So, if you find a method that works better for you, go for it!
